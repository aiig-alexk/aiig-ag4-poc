Please help me to generate a python function "preplexity_search" that call perplexity API to get the latest information about some country economical and political facts and information based on user query. 
The function should take two arguments: "country" and "user query" and return the search result as text . 

For Perplexity API reference, use the following code sample:
<code>
from openai import OpenAI YOUR_API_KEY = "INSERT API KEY HERE" messages = [ { "role": "system", "content": ( "You are an artificial intelligence assistant and you need to " "engage in a helpful, detailed, polite conversation with a user." ), }, { "role": "user", "content": ( "How many stars are in the universe?" ), }, ] client = OpenAI(api_key=YOUR_API_KEY, base_url="https://api.perplexity.ai") # chat completion without streaming response = client.chat.completions.create( model="llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online", messages=messages, ) print(response) # chat completion with streaming response_stream = client.chat.completions.create( model="llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online", messages=messages, stream=True, ) for response in response_stream: print(response)
</code>

Please adjust the code and prompts to use the argument "country" to provide the country context for the user query
